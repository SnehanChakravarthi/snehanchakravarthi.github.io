			Initially, I wanted to build the application with <Skillbox skill="svelte" /> in
			<Skillbox skill="sveltekit" /> wishing to take advantage of Svelte's nice global state logic, but
			my love for <Skillbox skill="next.js" /> combined with its amazing developer experience and the
			latest <span class="text-decoration">Server Actions</span> made me go with Next.js. Back into the
			world of <Skillbox skill="react" />, with <Skillbox skill="tailwindcss" />, I started to have
			fun coding the front end in a matter of days.
		</p>

		<HeadingLine title="backend" />
		<p>
			I built the server mostly utilising the new Server Actions, with <Skillbox skill="nodejs" />,
			and hosted on <Skillbox skill="vercel" /> ofc. Also used <span class="text-decoration"
				>edge functions</span
			> for couple of things in the application, to save money by not running function on the servers
			as there were long waiting periods for response from some API fetch calls from the LLMs, frequently
			hitting the <span class="text-decoration">Server Execution Limits</span> on Vercel.
		</p>

		<p>
			What else? I fully committed to <Skillbox skill="typescript" />. The database is built on <Skillbox
				skill="supabase"
			/>, and I was quickly able to set up <span class="text-decoration"
				>secure cookie based auth</span
			> and in no time I had a highly integrated RLS backed <Skillbox skill="postgresql" /> database,
			just waiting for my server actions to come fetch and feed them. The AI is powered by <Skillbox
				skill="openai"
			/> API.

			The final website is still under development, with more innovative features and updates coming
			to it. But it is already being used by a couple of organisations for testing and trying out
			the AI features on real interviews. Head over to <a
				href="https://www.acetrait.com"
				class="text-decoration">www.zerodavinci.com</a
			> to test it yourself.
			<br /><br />This project has led me to better understand AI and LLMs in general, and I had a
			great developer experience while coding this application. Largely it was thanks to the amazing
			libraries that simplifies the use of AI for the top LLMs providers like OpenAI, Mixtral etc.
